## Description

This application is designed for freelancers to have a place to store and track their personal projects that they have made. Users will be able to log into their personal account, see all the posts they've made, and create new project logs as well. Each project log will contain information such as the project name, description, hours spent, money earned, and more! This solves the problem of wondering where to keep an organized system of all finished projects and gives users a polished and clean UI to work with as well. What makes this application stand out is the ability for it to track the hours spent on a project and display that data in a chart for simple readability.
